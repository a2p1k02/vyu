# Vyu is crossplatform lightweight Image Viewer

## Lyrics:
I wrote this application because I was not happy with the performance of the "photography" application on Windows 10. <br>
I used my little knowledge of C++ and Qt. <br>
Hopefully this application will become a standard application in your practice.

## How do this:
1. Download last version my programm from Release block
2. Unzip archive to the new folder
3. Run vyu.exe in new folder
4. Enjoy
